# JAEJUN LEE

## TehcOps Engineer

Hello! I'm a Software Technical Engineer interested in big data and Docker/Kubernetes. I am currently working at NHN Soft, an NHN affiliate, and I am responsible for Toast cloud service technical inquiries and deployment management. I always like to learn, so if I don't know anything, I have the guts to go all the way. In addition to technical support, I am interested in development, so I am currently studying Java and Golang in addition to Python and accumulating development knowledge.

Thanks.
